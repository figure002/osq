    <h3>Two-player Online Mode</h3>
    <p>The Two-player Online mode allows you to play against an opponent across the internet. Currently, players do not choose their opponents, but are matched on a first-come, first-served basis. After users enter a screen name to identify themselves or their team, they are forwarded to a "lobby". If there is at least one other player waiting there, players are automatically matched and the game will begin. If there are no other players in lobby, a "Waiting for opponent..." messsage is displayed until an opponent arrives and the game begins. If two teams wish to compete in a scrimmage, it is recommended that they arrange a particular time to do so.</p>

        	<td class="title">Two-player Online Controls: </td>
            <td>Players can buzz-in either by using the Q key on the keyboard, or clicking the "Buzz-in to answer" button. Players may also click the "Pass" button to pass.
            <p> A message will appear indicating which player buzzed-in first. That player can use the mouse to select the button corresponding to the desired answer choice, or with the key that corresponds to the answer choice (W, X, Y, or Z). 
            <p> The player must then submit their answer either by clicking "Submit" or typing the "return" (or "enter") key on the keyboard.</td>
